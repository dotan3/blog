On this blog I will post my <abbr title="Capture The Flag">CTF</abbr> adventures, writeups, discoveries.

CTF are a great way to learn about computer/network security. I have been playing for 4 years when a former colleague of mine invited me to an onsite CTF.

Even thought I could not solve a single challenge on that first event, it was a game changer; since then I have been hooked and played as many CTF as I could.

> Try harder!
